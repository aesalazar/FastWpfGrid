This is a copy of the fork from the new defuct CodePlex FastWpfGrid.  The orginal repot this was forked from is now archived at https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=fastwpfgrid.  This fork adds the ability to show a filter row as well as some minor formatting options.  Note the row does not actually filter the data but rather fires an event to allow the developer to apply a filter.
