This is a copy of my fork from the now defucted CodePlex FastWpfGrid.  The orginal repo this is from is now archived at https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=fastwpfgrid.  This fork adds the ability to show a filter row as well as some minor formatting options.  Note the filter row does not actually filter the data but rather fires an event to allow the developer to apply a filter to the data source.
