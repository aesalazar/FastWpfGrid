This is a copy of my fork from the now defuct CodePlex FastWpfGrid repo.  This fork adds the ability to show a filter row as well as some minor formatting options.  Note the filter row does not actually filter the data but rather fires an event to allow the developer to apply a filter to the data source.

CodePlex is now completely gone but it looks like the original repo made it to GitHub before it was taken down:
